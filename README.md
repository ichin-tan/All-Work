# All-Work

This repository is a collection of my learning experiments, notes, and random projects across various technologies. It’s messy, unstructured, and reflects the raw process of my exploration and growth.

What's Inside?

- Learning Notes: Concepts and insights from my studies.
- Demos & Experiments: Small, quick projects and code snippets.
- Assignments: Coursework from my Mobile App Development program.
- Problem Solutions: Solved problems from platforms like LeetCode.
- Random Stuff: Anything else I’m experimenting with!
  
This is my space to:

- Learn and Experiment: A place to freely try out new technologies and ideas.
- Document My Progress: Capture the learning process, mistakes, and improvements.
